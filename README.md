- 👋 Hi, I’m @wdsonnek
- 👀 I’m interested in autotrading
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that my code is "abysmal," "an affront to God and man," "spaghetti," and "should not function HOW THE HELL IS THIS WORKING AT ALL--" 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on autotrading bots
- 📫 How to reach me: message, I suppose?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've bricked five test computers. Fear me.
